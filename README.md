## Dependencies

- TLP

## Install

Download and extract zip to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`, and restart gnome shell.

or

Using a browser that supports extension installation, visit https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1212/tlp-switcher/

## How To

Place TLP configuration files in `~/.tlp/`.

Create a new profile:

`tlp-stat -c > ~/.tlp/MyProfile`

or

`cp /etc/default/tlp ~/.tlp/MyProfile`

Selecting a profile will prompt you for root access to run [tlp_update.sh](tlp_update.sh). This script copys your profile to `/etc/default/tlp` and runs `tlp start`.

Changes to `~/.tlp/` (adding/removing profiles) are reflected (not applied) automatically.

## Gnome Version

This extension is built and tested under gnome 3.24.1. It _may_ work on previous versions of gnome but the metadata.json file only lists 3.24+. You can simply edit it and add your gnome version (if it works fine, leave me a comment so I can update the metadata.json).
